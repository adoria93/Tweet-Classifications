# Tweet-Classifications
Using Supervised Machine Learning algorithms

Twitter is an interesting place full of countless possibilities for analysis. Through Codecademny, I was able to use some twitter data they provided in order to practice machine learning techniques.

The first of these projects simply classifies a tweet coming from a city. In this case, the cities used are New York, London, and Paris. THe interesting thing about this project was how language played a role. The classifier was able to tell the difference between a tweet sent from New York and Paris pretty effectively, mainly due to the different in language. When it was time to look at whether or not a tweet was from New York or London, things got a little more tricky. (Located in Location, Location, Location.pdf)

The second project was all about what makes a tweet "go viral". Using a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier to help classify whether or not a tweet would be considered "viral" or not. This one was a bit harder to do since I had to classify what I considered the requirements for viral status were as well as picking the features out that would help classify that status.
